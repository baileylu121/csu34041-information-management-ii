## Conceptual Design

The process of **conceptual design** uses a high-level conceptual data model to create the conceptual schema for a database — in this case, the **Relational Model**. This is part of the requirements analysis process.

A **Conceptual Schema** is a concise description of the data requirements of the user, including descriptions of:

- Entity types
- Relationships
- Constraints

---

## Conceptual Design (cont.)

- The conceptual schema **does not include any implementation details** — hence, it can be used to communicate with non-technical users.
- It is used as a reference to ensure all data requirements are met, and that there are no conflicts.
- It is part of **physical and logical data independence**.

---

## Entity Relationship Model

- An **abstract and high-level conceptual representation** of information.
- **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)** — the diagrammatic notation of the ER model.
- Used to support the conceptual design of databases and help produce the conceptual schema.
- Describes data as **entities**, **relationships**, and **attributes**.

---

## Entities

The basic object that an ER diagram represents is an **entity**.

- An entity is a **real-world object with an independent existence** — physical or conceptual.
- Each entity has **attributes** which are the particular properties that describe the real-world object.

**Examples:** `PRODUCT`, `CUSTOMER`, `CAR`, `MOVIE`

---

## Attributes

Several types of attributes occur and need to be modelled in the Entity-Relationship Model:

- **Simple** vs **Composite**
- **Single-valued** vs **Multi-valued**
- **Stored** vs **Derived**

---

## Simple and Composite Attributes

- **Composite attributes** can be divided into smaller sub-parts.
  - *Example:* `Address`
- Attributes that are not divisible are called **simple** (or **atomic**) attributes.
  - *Example:* `Movie Certificate`, `Age`
- Composite attributes can be **hierarchical**.
  - *Example:* `Apartment number` → `Building number` → `Street`

---

## Single and Multi-Valued Attributes

- Most attributes have a **single value** for each entity — such attributes are called **single-valued**.
  - *Example:* `PPS number`, `Age`
- In some cases, an attribute can have a **set of values** for an entity — such attributes are called **multi-valued**.
  - *Example:* `Genre` for a `Movie`, `Colour` for a `Car`
  - Some entities may have one value, others multiple.

---

## Stored versus Derived Attributes

- In some cases, two or more attributes are related:
  - *Example:* `Age` and `BirthDate`
- `Age` can be calculated using today's date and a person's date of birth.
  - `Age` is therefore called a **derived attribute** — it is derivable from `BirthDate`.
  - `BirthDate` is called a **stored attribute**.

---

## Stored versus Derived Attributes (cont.)

Some attributes can be derived from information in **related entities**, rather than attributes:

- If a `number_of_employees` attribute was associated with a `CINEMA` entity, this could be derived by **totaling** the number of `employee` entries stored in the `EMPLOYEE` entity.

---

## Entity Types and Sets

ER diagrams **don't show single instances** of entities (or relations). They show **entity types**:

- An **entity type** is identified by its name and attributes.
  - *Example:* In a cinema database, `MOVIE` could be an entity type.
  - All movie entities share the same attributes, but each instance has its own value for each attribute.
- The **collection of all instances** of a particular entity type in a database is called an **entity set**.

| Entity Type | Entity Set |
|---|---|
| `EMPLOYEE` — Name, Age, Salary | John Smith, 55, 80,000<br>Fred Brown, 40, 30,000<br>Judy Clark, 25, 45,000<br>… |
| `DEPARTMENT` — Name, Location, Manager | Research, Dundrum, John Smith<br>Sales, Dublin 1, Judy Clark<br>Online, Finglas, Bob King<br>… |

---

## Entity Relationship Diagrams

| Notation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Rectangular box** | Entity Type (encloses the entity name) |
| **Oval** | Attribute (attached to entity type by straight line) |
| **Double oval** | Multi-valued attribute |
| **Straight lines** | Composite attributes (attached to component attributes) |

---

## Key Attributes

- Each entity type usually has **one or more attributes** whose values are **unique** for each instance in the entity set.
- An attribute whose values are used to uniquely identify each entity is called the **key attribute**.
  - *Examples:* `ISBN`, `PPS`, `Student Number`
- More than one attribute can be used to form the key — in this case the **combination** must be unique (**composite key**).

**Key attributes are represented by <u>underlining</u> the attribute.**

### Example: `MOVIE`

```
        Director
           │
           ▼
     ┌─────┴─────┐
     │   Running   │
     │   Time      │
     └─────┬─────┘
           │
    ┌──────┴──────┐
    ▼             ▼
  Title      Release Date
                 │
          ┌──────┴──────┐

          ▼
        Genre
          │
          ▼
        Cert
```

*(Underlined attributes are key attributes.)*

---

## Key Attributes (cont.)

- Specifying the key attribute places a **uniqueness constraint** on the entity type — this must hold for every instance of an entity in the entity set.
- The key constraint is **derived from the real-world requirements** that the database represents.

### Example: `CAR` with composite key

```
     ┌──────────────────────┐

     │   Year               │
     │                      │
     │        CAR           │
     │                      │
     │   Model              │

     └──────────────────────┘
```

## Example — Movie Theatres

**Scenario:** Model a chain of Movie Theatres where the movie chain consists of theatres containing (movie) screen rooms in which screenings (of movies) are held.

**Entity types identified:**

- `MOVIE`
- `THEATRE`
- `SCREEN`
- `SCREENING`

## Relationships

- A **relationship** captures how two or more entity types are related to one another.
- Whenever an attribute of an entity type refers to another entity type, a relationship exists.
  - *Implicit relationships:* `SCREEN` and `THEATRE`, `SCREENING` and `MOVIE`, `SCREENING` and `SCREEN`.
  - In the ER model, these references should **not** be represented as attributes, but as **relationships**.

A relationship can be informally thought of as a **verb**, linking two or more **nouns**:

- "manages" — between an employee and a department
- "performs" — between an artist and a song
- "teaches" — between a lecturer and a student
- "proved" — between a mathematician and a theorem

---

## Relationship Types and Sets

- As with entities, relationships have a **relationship type**, illustrated in an ER diagram.
- The collection of all instances of a particular relationship type is called a **relationship set**.
- Related entity types are said to **participate** in a relationship type.
- Each relationship instance, *rᵢ*, is an association of entities, where the association includes exactly one entity from each of the participating entity types.

---

## Relationship Types — Example

```
    MOVIE ──────── SHOW ──────── SCREENING
                (Shown in)      (Shows)
```

---

## Binary and Ternary Relationships

- The **degree** of a relationship type is the number of entity types that participate.
  - The `SHOW` relationship is of **degree two**.
- Relationship types of degree two are called **binary**.
- Relationship types of degree three are called **ternary**.

### Ternary Example

```
    PART ──────── SUPPLY ──────── COMPANY
                  (SUPPLY)
          │
          ▼
     SUPPLIER
```

---

## Relationship Roles

- Each entity type that participates in a relationship type plays a particular **role**.
- A **role name** can be optionally added to an ER diagram to clearly identify what the relationship means.

```
    MOVIE ──(Shows)── SHOW ───(Shown in)── SCREENING
```

---

## Recursive Relationships

- In some cases, the **same entity type** participates more than once in a relationship type, in different roles.
- Such relationships are called **recursive relationships**.
- The **relationship roles** are key in distinguishing the role each participating entity plays.

### Example: `EMPLOYEE` — `SUPERVISION`

```
    EMPLOYEE ──(Supervises)── SUPERVISION ──(Supervised by)── EMPLOYEE
```

The `SUPERVISION` relationship relates an employee to a supervisor, where both employee and supervisor are members of the **same entity set**.

---

## Relationship Constraints

Constraints **limit the possible combination** of entities that can participate in a relationship. These constraints are determined by the **real-world requirements** being modelled.

Two main types of relationship constraint:

1. **Cardinality Constraints** — specify the *maximum* number of relationship instances an entity can participate in.
2. **Participation Constraints** — specify the *minimum* number of relationship instances an entity can participate in.

---

## Cardinality Constraints

Consider the `SHOW` relationship type:

- Cardinality ratio for `MOVIE : SCREENINGS` is **1 : N**
  - Each movie can be shown in **many** screenings.
  - Each screening shows a **maximum of one** movie.

```
    MOVIE ───(1)─── SHOW ───(N)─── SCREENING
             (Shown in)     (Shows)
```

### Possible Cardinality Ratios for Binary Relationships

| Ratio | Name |
|---|---|
| **1 : 1** | One to One |
| **1 : N** | One to Many |
| **M : N** | Many to Many |

---

## Cardinality Constraints — Examples

### ? : ? — Employment

```
    CONTRACT
    (contracts)
       │
       ▼
    EMPLOYMENT
    (is contracted by)
       │
       ▼
    EMPLOYEE
```

### 1 : 1 — One to One

```
    CONTRACT
    (contracts)
       │
    1  │  1
       │
       ▼
    EMPLOYMENT
    (is contracted by)
       │
       ▼
    EMPLOYEE
```

### 1 : N — One to Many

```
    LECTURER ───(Teaches)── LECTURE ───(Learns from)── STUDENT
         │                   (M)                    (N)
```

---

## Participation Constraints

Specify the **minimum** number of relationship instances that an entity can participate in.

Two types:

- **Total participation** — every entity must participate.
- **Partial participation** — some entities participate, others do not.

Formally, participation constraints specify if the **existence** of an entity depends on its being related to another entity via the relationship type.

---

## Total Participation

Company policy states that **every Employee MUST work for a department**:

```
    EMPLOYEE ─════ WORKS ─════ DEPARTMENT
        │        (Works in)   (Employs)
        │            │              │
        │         (N)            (1)
        │
    ════ (double line = total participation)
```

An employee entity can **only exist** if they participate in at least one `WORKS` relationship between `EMPLOYEE` and `DEPARTMENT`.

- The participation of `EMPLOYEE` in `WORKS` is called **total participation**.
- Total participation is also called **existence dependency**.

---

## Partial Participation

In the same company, **not every employee** will be responsible for managing a department:

```
    EMPLOYEE ────── MANAGE ────── DEPARTMENT
        │        (manages)   (managed by)
        │           │             │
        │          (N)           (1)
        │
    ─── (single line = partial participation)
```

An employee entity can **exist** without participating in the `MANAGE` relationship.

- The participation of `EMPLOYEE` in `MANAGE` is called **partial participation**.

Together, **cardinality constraints** and **participation constraints** are referred to as the **structural constraints** of a relationship type.

### Notation

| Notation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Single line** | Partial participation |
| **Double line** | Total participation (existence dependency) |

---

## Relationship Type Attributes

In the Entity Relationship Model, **relationship types can have attributes**, similar to entity types.

```
    EMPLOYEE ──── MANAGE ──── DEPARTMENT
        │      (Start Date)      │
        │                        │
        │         (manages)      │
        │         (managed by)   │
```

### Migrating Relationship Attributes

These relationship attributes can be migrated to participating entities depending on cardinality:

| Cardinality | Migration Rule |
|---|---|
| **1 : 1** | Attribute can be migrated to **either** side |
| **1 : N** | Attribute can only be migrated to the **N side** |
| **M : N** | Attribute **cannot** be migrated; remains as a relationship attribute |

### 1 : 1 Example

```
    EMPLOYEE ───(Start Date)─── CONTRACT ───(Start Date)─── EMPLOYMENT
        │                        (contracts)                 │
        │                                                     │
        │                       (is contracted by)            │
        │                                                     │
        └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 1 : N Example

```
    EMPLOYEE ────(Start Date)─── MANAGE ──── DEPARTMENT
        │                          (manages)
        │                          (managed by)
        │
     (1)                             (N)
```

The `Start Date` attribute migrates to the **N side** (`DEPARTMENT`).

### M : N Example

```
    LECTURER ──(Contact, Hours)── LECTURE ──(Learns from)── STUDENT
           (Teaches)                 (M)                    (N)
```

The `Contact` and `Hours` attributes **cannot** be migrated and remain as relationship attributes.

---

## Cinema Example (Revisited)

**Scenario:** Present the relationships between `MOVIE`, `THEATRE`, `SCREENING`, and `SCREEN`:

- A movie is **shown in** a screening
- A Screen (room) **has a location in** a theatre
- A Screening **is displayed in** a Screen (room)

## DVD Shop Example

**Scenario:** Model a DVD Rental shop called **LotsoVision**:

- The shop stores information about the DVDs it rents (titles, cert, genre, etc.) and the customers that rent them (Name, Address, Phone, etc.).
- A customer can rent **many** DVDs. Each DVD can be rented to **many** customers.
